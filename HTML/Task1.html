<h1>kullumanali</h1>
<p class="one">Manali is a high-altitude Himalayan resort town in India’s northern Himachal Pradesh state. It has a reputation as a backpacking center and honeymoon destination. Set on the Beas River, it’s a gateway for skiing in the Solang Valley and trekking in Parvati Valley. It's also a jumping-off point for paragliding, rafting and mountaineering in the Pir Panjal mountains, home to 4,000m-high Rohtang Pass.</p>
<h2>PLACES TO VISIT KULLUMANALI</h2>
<p>A trip to Kullu Manali is the medicine for fatigued minds and tired souls. Nature has blessed them generously, and yet, one is different from the kind of experiences they offer. Kullu is called the “land of the gods”, and quite aptly so. Stretched out leisurely on the banks of the River Beas, it is blessed with a magnificent scenery characterized by forests, valleys, streams, rivers and orchards. Mystical Malana to serene Manikaran, it lures tourists for many reasons. </p>
